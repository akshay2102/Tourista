Kullu has several hot water springs dotting its landscape, believed to have curative powers. Among the most visited is the Kheerganga at Manikaran. These hot water springs seem to emerge from the rocks and are whitish in colour. A dip here is believed to cure gastric problems and rheumatic pains. For skin diseases, a dip in the hot water springs at Kalath, Manali is a must. Vashishtha Springs are also famous for the Turkish baths built by the Tourism Department.
