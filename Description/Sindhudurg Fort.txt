This magnificent sea fort was built by Shivaji during 1664-1667 dedicated to the glory of the Maratha Empire. It literally means “Ocean Fort” and indeed is a sight to behold. Located on the island of Kurte, it is said that Shivaji hired over 3000 brawny men to build the stronghold. This fort is accessible by a ferry and regular ferries ply to and from this great fort. A definite must-visit for history and culture buffs!
