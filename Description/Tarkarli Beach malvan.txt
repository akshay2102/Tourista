This long stretch of crystalline sand and shimmering clear waters is an excellent getaway for the city-dwellers. The breeze is soft and heavy with the scent of salt and you can just lay back and relax to your heart’s content. Adding to the scenic beauty of Tarkarli beach are the tiny hamlets situated nearby. Watch out for dolphins as dolphin sightings are not rare here.
