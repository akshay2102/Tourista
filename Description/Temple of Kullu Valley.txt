Basheshwar Mahadev Temple is believed to be the largest and most spectacularly built. Built in typical Pahari style, Bijli Mahadev Temple is one of the toughest to reach. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and derives its name from the fact that the shivling inside has, time and again, been shattered by lightening. The priests put together the shivling with ghee. Similar in style to the Bijli Mahadev temple, the Bhuvneshwari Temple is also built in Pahari style. The temple walls are adorned with Kangra-style paintings of Durga and the stone lion placed in the courtyard is built beautifully. Vaishno Devi Temple is a relatively new temple and is located on the National Highway near Kullu. Dedicated to the patron deity of Kullu, Raghunath Temple is the site of the famous Kullu Dusshera celebrations. Legends have it that Lord Rama performed the Ashwamedha Yajna before this very idol.
